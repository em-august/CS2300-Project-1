                In second grade, I realized my love of learning, writing, and storytelling... so I wrote a book. It was not published, but I was very proud of it. Several years later, when I was a senior in high school, I published it as a nostalgic present to myself and a celebration of my love of learning, teaching, creating, and sharing. I truly love working with students and children and sharing any stories and knowledge I can with the world.
